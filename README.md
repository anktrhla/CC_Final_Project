Creative Coding Final Project. The project demonstrates machine learning through genetic algorithm.

Title: HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS

Inspired by Smart Rockets - http://www.blprnt.com/smartrockets/

The birds have to reach their home, but they have to pave their own way across the obstacles that lie in their path.
This algorithm allows new populations to respawn every certain number of frames and with a greater fitness rate to reach the birds' nest with a specified amount of mutation rate.
